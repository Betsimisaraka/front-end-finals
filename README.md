In this project I built a website which shows many kind of photos. And it provide some examples of the photographs that the photographer has taken in the deserts of Morroco. This application is made with `Html`, `Css` and `Sass`

## Functionality
  - Clean HTML, accurate, consistent, use the right elements, accessible, valid, nice structure and valid.
  - Progressively enhancing my HTML, e.g. using `<picture>` elements with multiple sources.
  - Clean Sass, I used variables at a minimum extend with mixins, functions, abstract classes, orderly output, and expected.
  - Added style to elements that the user can focus, hover over, or interact with.
  - Responsive design and using Custom Properties.
  - I compressed the images to make the page load faster.
  - I used WOFF2 and WOFF for the fonts formats. 
  - I made the menu on mobile work nicely, using my imagination, you can slide the images and I used Webp as my image format.
