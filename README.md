In this project we built a website that is about photograph. This webpage shows how beautiful photos are. And it provide some examples of the photographs that the photographer have taken in the deserts of Morroco. This application is made by `html` and `css/sass`

## 1- My demo

You can see my demo by clicking this github link with the username [Betsimisaraka](https://github.com/Betsimisaraka/front-end-assessment)

## 1- Explaination about the structure of my project.
This project structures as the folowing instruction below:

First, I have a folder called `source-materials` which contains three subfolders that are the `images`, the `fonts` and the `icons`. Inside of these we can see all the necessary fonts, images and icons that are necessary for this project.

And then, there is a folder called `scss` in which all of my scss files stored.

Lastly `Webroot` folder this is the bigest folder that store the web-files in this application. This contains the `index.html` file, `images` folder which store the images that have been compiled, also `fonts` folder this also contains all of the fonts that have been formated and converted into `woff` and `woff2` and lastly the `css` folder where you can see the output of the `scss` files. I also use a `script` file which has a little bit of javascript to make the image slider work fine.

## Fuctionality

- **All the HTML**
  - Your HTML should be clean, accurate, and consistent.
  - Use the right elements for the right job.
  - Structure your HTML nicely.
  - Make sure your HTML is accessible.
  - Make sure your HTML is valid.
  - *Bonus points*: Progressively enhancing your HTML, e.g. using `<picture>` elements with multiple sources.
- **As much Sass as you can**
  - Your Sass should use variables at a minimum, and be extended with mixins, functions, and abstract classes if you can.
  - Your Sass output should be orderly, and expected.
  - Keep your SCSS files clean
  - Add helpful comments to the difficult-to-understand parts.
  - You don't have to style everything within the time-frame. But we want to see completed components where possible.
- **CSS**
  - Add style to elements that the user can focus, hover over, or interact with.
  - Your work should be Mobile-First by default, and Responsive.
  - *Bonus points*: Use Custom Properties if you can.
- **Images**
  - Are you using a CSS `background-image` or an `<img>` in the HTML? Make sure it's for the right reasons.
  - Use the correct image format for each case
  - *Bonus points*: Compress your images
- **Fonts**
  - If you'd like, use a `fonts.google.com`-supplied stylesheet for the fonts, but we really want to see you use your own `@font-face` declarations. Link up the WOFF2 and WOFF formats to your CSS using as many `@font-face` at-rules as you need.
  - Use `local()` functions for locally-installed fonts.
  - Test that your website works without local font support.
  - *Bonus points*: Subset your fonts
- **General**
  - No spelling or grammar mistakes please
  - Test, test, test!
  - Don't feel pressure to complete the entire page, but rather try complete each component you start. **Leave out the bits that look too complex and work on them at the end!**
  - Ensure your commits are frequent and well-described.
- **Advanced**
  - Make the menu on mobile work nicely, use your own imagination here.
  - *Bonus points*: Make the Image Slider, and other components work as intended, maybe you'll need some JS?
  - *Bonus points*: Use newer image formats such as WebP and AVIF, while still maintaining support for older formats.
